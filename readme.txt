COMSC 211: Data Structures
Overview

This is the third course in the major track for computer science and is programming-intensive. The course will teach you core data structures concepts and will provide you with further java programming experience by requiring you to put those concepts into code.

Data structures allow you to organize data for efficient queries and updates. The choice of data structure is intimately tied to the application or problem at hand. To effectively understand when one choice may be advantageous over another, this course will also teach some very basic tools used in the analysis of algorithms.
